</center>

Sepsis is a bacterial infection within the bloodstream and is
life-threatening. Any type of infection could cause sepsis such as
catheter sites, wounds, burns, kidney, etc. In sepsis the body is over
actively working to fight the infection and as a result lead to septic
shock (severe drop in blood pressure) that can lead to tissue damage,
organ failure and even death. Symptoms include shivering, fast and
shallow breathing, etc.

Anyone is susceptible to sepsis, but the people with the highest risk
are infants, children, older adults, and people with underlying health
conditions such as AIDS and cancer.[^1] As well as pregnant women,
newborns, and medical conditions such as diabetes, obesity and kidney
disease.[^2]

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in a given
year, 1 of 3 patients who have died within the hospital had sepsis
during hospitalization, however, nearly 87% of sepsis cases starts
before the patient goes to the hospital.[^3] Further, it is a leading
cause of death in hospitals.[^4] Sepsis therefore leaves hospital
healthcare institutions in a precarious situation. How do ultimately
help a patient get better and not be subjected to malpractice suits?

The purpose of this project is to classify if a patient with sepsis will
die within a hospital. The goals of this study is to:

1.  Better equip/train hospital staff for potential sepsis complications
    and thus create internal protocols, and also improve status quo.
2.  Promote the uncovering of the underlying reasons why a patient dies
    within a hospital via academic research.
3.  Protect hospital institutions from legal ramifications by
    identifying if sepsis occurred in a patient before hospital
    admittance.

A special acknowledgement to the University of Irvine Data Repository
for providing this dataset.[^5]

The dataset contains 4 clinical features as follows:

-   age(int): years: integer
-   sex(binary): 0=male and 1=female
-   episode_number (int):
-   hospital_outcome(boolean): 0=dead and 1=alive

Let’s explore

## Exploratory Data Analysis

``` r
summary(data)
```

    ##       age         sex       epi       result    
    ##  Min.   :  0.00   0:57973   1:84811   0:  8105  
    ##  1st Qu.: 51.00   1:52231   2:16688   1:102099  
    ##  Median : 68.00             3: 5403             
    ##  Mean   : 62.74             4: 2199             
    ##  3rd Qu.: 81.00             5: 1103             
    ##  Max.   :100.00

We see a few interesting insights from the summary function:

1.  The mean is 62 and the median is 68 which means that Age as a
    symmetrical distribution.
2.  Male and Females are almost the same, with slightly more males.
3.  epi has more of the 1 category than the others. **Need to find more
    research about it and go back to the paper.**
4.  More people with sepsis lived than died within the confines of the
    hospital.

Let’s visually check out the dataset.

``` r
#create a histogram
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, fill= result)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = .5, color = 'black') +
  facet_wrap(~result, scales= 'free_y') +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'Age Distribution by Frequency to Those Who Died/Lived',
       subtitle = '0=Died and 1=Alive',
       y = 'Frequency',
       x = 'Age')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

We see two interesting insights:

-   Due to the facet wrap, we see that there are more people who lived
    than died.
-   Based on the Age distribution, we see that both populations were
    majority in the elderly age group and thus are right skewed.

Let’s see how they both compare.

``` r
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, fill=result)) +
  geom_bar(position = 'dodge' ) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = 'Age Distribution by Count to Those Who Died/Lived',
       subtitle = '0=Died and 1=Alive',
       y = 'Count',
       x = 'Age')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

Visually, we see that there is big difference in terms of size. We see
that there is obviously more females in study than there were males
across all ages.

Let’s check out their density.

``` r
#create a density plot
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, fill= sex)) +
  geom_density(alpha = .5, color = 'black') +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(title = 'Age Distribution by Density to Sex',
       subtitle = '0= Male and 1= Female',
       y = 'Density',
       x = 'Age')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

In terms of density, both male and females are overlapping and thus
similar.

``` r
#create a violin plot
ggplot(data, aes(x=epi, y=age, fill=sex)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = .5, color='black') +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(title = 'Epi by Age to Sex',
       subtitle = '0= Male and 1= Female',
       y = 'Age',
       x = 'Epi (Categorical)')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

Insights:

-   We see across both sexes and episodes that majority of the patients
    were the age 60+. What this could possibly mean is that Sepsis is
    likely to be caused in older age brackets and an insight we can
    gather is that when an older patient that is admitted to the
    hospital it could signal to the nursing staff that said patient may
    likely have a sepsis and precautions could be taken in the nursing
    unit.

``` r
ggplot(data, aes(x=epi, fill=result)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = .5, color='black', position = 'dodge', width=0.5,
           show.legend = TRUE) +
  facet_wrap(~ epi, scales = 'free') +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(title = 'Epi Distribution by Count to Those Who Died/Lived',
       subtitle = '0=Died and 1=Alive',
       y = 'Count',
       x = 'Epi (Categorical)')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)<!-- -->

In terms of Episodes there are a number of insights:

-   In terms of sexes, there are clearly more females in all episodes.
    This insight was expected given the disproportionate rate of males
    to females
-   In terms of episodes, it is clear that most of the patients
    episodies were categorized majority in 1 and least in 5.

``` r
#create a boxplot
ggplot(data, aes(x=result, y=age, fill=sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(alpha = .5, color = 'black') +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(title = 'Result by Age to Sex',
       subtitle = '0= Male and 1= Female',
       y = 'Age',
       x = 'Result (Categorical)')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png)<!-- -->

Insights:

-   In results, in those patients that died (0), we see that both male
    and females had outliers in the lower part of the box plot. Women
    age was slightly higher than males. \*In the results, in those
    patients that lived (1), we see that the females had a better
    distrivtuion than that of males.

``` r
#create a barchart
ggplot(data, aes(x=result, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = .5, color='black', width = 0.5) +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(title = 'Results by Count to Sex',
       subtitle = '0= Male and 1= Female',
       y = 'Count',
       x = 'Result')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)<!-- -->

The default code to build a barchart is not helpful in drawing any
insights. There is a need to scale each result (0 and 1) based on their
respective y-axis metrics. THe code below does that.

``` r
#create a better  barchart
ggplot(data, aes(x=result, fill=sex)) +
  geom_bar(alpha = .5, color='black', width = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ result, scales = 'free') +
  scale_fill_discrete_qualitative() +
  theme_bw() +
    labs(title = 'Results by Count to Sex',
       subtitle = '0= Male and 1= Female',
       y = 'Count',
       x = 'Result')
```

![](Sepsis-Survival-Classification-Naives-Bayes_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png)<!-- -->

Insights:

-   We see that there is about a \~2000 total patient difference between
    the results group 0 and 1.
-   We see that the distribution of the sexes is slightly favorable
    towards the 0 group in both result groups.
-   We can say that the study did a good job in getting a sample of
    sexes and results that are approximate.

## Naives Bayes

Naive Bayes (NB) is a machine learning classifier based on Bayes’
Theorem (describes the relationship of conditional probabilities).
Further, NB uses the Bayes theorem which states we can find the
probability of A given B. The core fo the theorem is is the assumption
that each pair of features are independent of each other.[^6] Thus, the
presence of one feature does not affect the outcome of the other (hence
the name “naive”).For example, in surfing, if the day’s temperature is
hot does not mean the weather’s humidity is hot. Another assumption is
that all the features have an equal effect on the dependent variable.
For example, in surfing, the day being cloudy does not affect the
decision to surf.

</center>

In the figure above, we are trying to find the probability of A given
that B is true/has already occurred.

The variable A represents the class variable (to surf or not). Variable
B represents the features (temperature, humidity, weather, etc.)

</center>

### Applications

-   Sentiment Analysis. Identify positive and negative customer reviews.
-   Spam filtering. Identify spam emails.
-   Classify articles. Is the article, politics, healthcare, or oil &
    gas.

The assumption is A and B are independent.
</center>

### Pros

-   Quick and easy to implement
-   Useful for multiclass predictions as it is suited for categorical
    variables than numerical variables
-   No iterations
-   Requires small amount of training data and thus is NB is useful for
    small datasets.
-   When independent predictors assumptions are true, NB performs better
    than other models.

### Cons

-   Conditional independence assumption is not always true as there are
    cases where features are dependent on each other.
-   Zero frequency problem, which is when a category variable is present
    in the test data set and not in the train dataset, the model will
    make a 0 probability.

Let’s look diagonally:

-   0 patients were correctly predicted as classified as Dead (result =
    0)
-   71551 patients were correctly predicted as classified as Alive
    (result = 1).

``` r
#calculate miscalculation error
1-sum(diag(CM1))/sum(CM1)
```

    ## [1] 0.07349761

Misclassifications are about 7%.

Let’s repeat for test set

``` r
#store prediction in an object
predict2 <- predict(model, test)

#create a confusion matrix
CM2 <- table(predicted = predict2, actual = test$result)

print(CM2)
```

    ##          actual
    ## predicted     0     1
    ##         0     0     0
    ##         1  2429 30548

``` r
test %>%
  summarize(accuracy = mean(result == 1))
```

    ##    accuracy
    ## 1 0.9263426

``` r
test %>%
  summarize(accuracy = mean(result == 0))
```

    ##    accuracy
    ## 1 0.0736574

Let’s look diagonally:

-   0 patients were correctly predicted as classified as Dead (result =
    0).
-   30548 patients were correctly predicted as classified as Alive
    (result = 1).

``` r
#calculate miscalculation error
1-sum(diag(CM2))/sum(CM2)
```

    ## [1] 0.0736574

Misclassifications are about 7%.

## Limitations

One limitation is that although both miscalculation errors for the train
and test dataset are low, about 7%, the model failed to predict
accurately those who died within the hospital in both datasets. In fact,
it the model got it all wrong! This can be due to prevalence; there is
more 1 (Alive) than there is 0 (Dead) within the dataset.

If our dataset in our train is biased then our results in out test will
be biased as well.
